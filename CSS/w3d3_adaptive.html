            <p>In one of the most remote regions of Eve Online, a suspected botter lost eight Nyxes over a period of four hours.
                What makes the losses extremely puzzling at first glance is the fact that these extremely strong ships were
                brought down by a small gang of relatively pedestrian sub-capitals. However, as the night went on, more and
                more Nyxes died to the same small group, in the same region, all with the same fit. What had happened became
                clear: a ratting bot (a program that automates the activity of making ISK) either broke, or a vulnerability
                was found.</p>
